This repository consists of some of my solutions to assignments for the 5 cr course "Advanced Course in Programming" ("Ohjelmoinnin jatkokurssi") offered by the University of Helsinki as MOOC in the autumn 2020. MOOC stands for Massive Open Online Course which means that the course is open for everyone. All course material and assignments can be found in https://python-s20.mooc.fi/ in Finnish. Sections 8-14 belong to the "Advanced Course in Programming".
